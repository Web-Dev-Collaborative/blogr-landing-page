## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Cool landing page, which gives you an opportunity to practice working with menus that also have some sub-menus. However, I'll admit that this is not the cleanest code that I've ever written, and I think I could do a lot better. But I'm not really upset because I was experimenting and trying to do some new things with BEM. Experiments can be expensive sometimes, and this time it was expensive in terms of time. Initially I expected to finish this project in 2 days, but due to experimenting and some other personal things it took me 5-6 days. In brief, I just want to remind everyone that don't get upset if things don't go as planned and your expectations don't come true, because we all learn and grow with those experiments.
